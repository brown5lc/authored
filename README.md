# Authored

## Description

- Authored is a lightweight web IDE for university courses where instructors create classrooms and assignments (tests, skeletons, guardrails). As students code, the IDE records a tamper-evident timeline of edits, pastes, and runs so TAs can replay the process and grade in-browser. Ideally it would also have some automatic tampering detection, but that would be further down the line. There’s also an opt-in AI tutor that never writes code, it guides with concepts, documentation, and test ideas to teach responsible AI use.
