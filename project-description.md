### **Description:**

Students in university programming courses often struggle with environment setup, inconsistent tooling, and confusion between different IDEs, which can slow down learning and create unnecessary frustration. At the same time, AI tools have become widely accessible, but most students receive little guidance on how to use them responsibly, ethically, and in ways that support their understanding rather than replacing it. Instructors also lack platforms that combine assignment management, code execution academic integrity monitoring, and structured AI literacy in a single
cohesive system.

Existing IDEs are powerful but usually too complex for beginners, and cloud-based tools don’t always offer academic-focused features or clear integrity safeguards. Meanwhile, general-purpose AI assistants often provide full solutions or highly detailed code, making them ineffective, or even harmful, in an educational setting. None of the available tools strike a balance between simplicity, ethical AI use, and the specific needs of classroom programming assignments.

Recent improvements in browser-based coding environments make it possible to run code safely inside sandboxes while providing a consistent experience across devices. Activity logging systems can give instructors transparency into student work habits, and educational AI assistants can be designed in a no-code style that supports conceptual understanding without generating full answers. These technologies form the foundation for a more reliable, teaching-oriented coding platform.

My approach with Authored is to create a browser-based IDE tailored for university courses, where students can write, run, and submit code without needing to install anything. The system includes assignment creation tools for instructors, secure sandboxed execution, and activity logs that support academic integrity. A built-in no-code AI assistant teaches students how to use modern AI tools safely and ethically, guiding them through problem-solving rather than handing them completed solutions. By focusing on consistency, accessibility, and responsible AI use, Authored aims to improve the classroom programming experience for both students and instructors.
