# Individual Capstone Assesment

My senior design project, Authored, is a browser-based IDE designed for university programming courses that integrates logging, and a no-code AI assistant to teach responsible and ethical AI use. From my individual academic perspective, this project represents a culmination of the skills I’ve developed throughout the CS curriculum, combining software engineering principles, user-centered design, and responsible AI literacy. The platform focuses on making it easier for students to write, run, and submit code in a consistent environment without installation issues, while providing instructors with tools to manage assignments and review activity logs that support academic integrity. The AI assistant component reflects a growing need to guide students in using modern tools ethically rather than relying on them as shortcuts. I see this project as both technically challenging and personally meaningful because it blends accessibility, educational value, and emerging AI considerations in a way that aligns with my interests. Authored is ultimately designed to improve the classroom programming experience for students and instructors alike.

My college curriculum has given me the technical foundation to build a system like Authored, and several courses directly influence how I think about the project’s design and implementation. For example, Data Structures, and Operating Systems helped me appreciate efficiency, memory considerations, and the complexities behind code execution models, all of which matter when designing a safe and scalable sandbox. In addition, Software Testing & Quality Assurance shaped the way I think about correctness, verification, and building reliable features. Beyond technical material, courses like Professional Development coursework helped develop my communication and project-planning skills, which are important for maintaining documentation and structuring the system over an extended development timeline. Together, these classes have prepared me to approach this project carefully, systematically, and with confidence.

My co-op experiences have also shaped the way I approach Authored, especially in terms of practical engineering habits, real-world software workflows, and working with complex systems. At Siemens DISW, where I worked as a Software Engineering Intern, I gained hands-on experience with large C++ codebases, version control, and debugging tools, all of which taught me how to reason about software architecture at scale. My time at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) was even more influential, as I rebuilt a VR training application from scratch using Three.js, WebXR, and open-source tooling. This experience strengthened my ability to design clean interfaces, manage async workflows, and structure frontend–backend communication in a way that feels directly applicable to Authored’s architecture. These co-ops also improved my interpersonal skills, problem-solving abilities, and sense of ownership over long-term projects, which will guide how I manage development, scope, and documentation. The practical mix of technical depth and collaborative strategies from both positions gives me confidence in building a polished and maintainable system.

I’m genuinely motivated to work on Authored because I care about improving the learning experience for CS students and helping them navigate AI tools responsibly. As someone who has seen peers struggle with environment setup or fall into the trap of using AI tools without understanding them, I believe this project addresses a real and growing need. I’m also excited because the project blends several of my interests, frontend development, educational tooling, ethical AI use, and UI/UX design, into something cohesive and practical. My early approach focuses on building a minimal but functional foundation: a stable editor, a basic assignment flow, secure sandboxed execution, and an AI assistant that guides students rather than giving answers. I plan to iterate in small steps, refining features based on usability and clarity. This approach keeps the project manageable while ensuring real progress each semester.

By the end of the project, I expect to deliver a fully functional demo of Authored with assignment creation, code execution, submission workflows, activity logs, and an integrated no-code AI assistant that models responsible AI behavior. My goal is for the platform to feel clean, intuitive, and educationally useful. To evaluate my contributions, I’ll look at whether the system behaves consistently across devices, whether instructors can realistically use it without confusion, and whether the AI assistant truly reinforces ethical engagement rather than shortcuts. I will also compare the final product against the milestones, design diagrams, and goals established earlier in the development process. If the system is stable, documented, usable, and demonstrates the core features I set out to build, I will consider the project a success. Ultimately, I’ll judge my performance not just by functionality, but by the clarity, reliability, and educational value of the final result.
