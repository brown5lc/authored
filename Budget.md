# Budget

At this point in the project, there have been no expenses incurred. All development tools, libraries, and frameworks used so far are free or open-source, and no hardware, software licenses, or paid services have been required. Additionally, there have been no donated items or external financial contributions, so the monetary value of donations is $0.

Future costs may arise during the implementation and testing of hosted services, such as cloud infrastructure for running the platform and API usage fees for large language model integrations. However, these have not yet been utilized, so they do not contribute to the current budget. For now, the project continues with no financial obligations.
