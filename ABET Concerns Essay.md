# ABET Concerns Essay

Working on Authored brings a few real-world constraints that shape what the project can actually be. Ethically, the biggest thing is that the system logs student activity, so I have to be careful about how that information is used and make sure it doesn’t feel like spying. The goal is to support academic integrity, not to micromanage people, so the design has to respect that balance. Legally, anything involving student data means thinking about rules like FERPA, which limits what information can be stored and who can see it. Even the open-source tools I use matter, since I need to make sure their licenses are allowed in a university setting. On the security side, the platform needs to safely run whatever code students submit without opening giant holes in the server, so sandboxing and protecting user data becomes a big part of the design. There’s also a professional angle, since this project reflects on me and needs to look like something made with real planning and care, not just a quick hack. All of these constraints don’t stop the project, but they definitely put some rails around it and shape how the final system should behave.
