## User Stories:

### Professor:

As a professor, I want to create classrooms and assignments with tests, skeleton code, and guardrails so that grading is consistent and setup time is minimal.

### Professor/TA

As a teaching assistant, I want to replay a student’s edit/paste/run timeline and run tests in the browser so that I can assess originality and give targeted feedback quickly without configuring local environments.

### Student:

As a student, I want an opt-in no-code AI coach that explains concepts and suggests test ideas so that I can learn responsibly and debug without being handed solutions.
