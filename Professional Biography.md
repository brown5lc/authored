## Type of Project Sought

I am seeking opportunities to further develop immersive, interactive applications that connect real-time data with intuitive user experiences. In particular, I am interested in:

- VR/AR prototypes for engineering, design, or training environments.
- Web Based Games
- Tools that integrate live data streams (video, telemetry, sensor data) into user-friendly interfaces.
